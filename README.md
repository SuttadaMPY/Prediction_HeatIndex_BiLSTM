# Prediction_HeatIndex_BiLSTM
The prediction of Heat Index (HI) value at the area surrounding 5 meteorological stations in Thailand.

This project proposes the prediction of HI values using a neural network model, namely Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)
Data contains four meteorological variables: dry temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. The data is daily recorded from five meteorological stations in Thailand — Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Bangkok, Rayong, and Phuket — every 3 hours starting at 1 A.M. from 2014 to 2023.
